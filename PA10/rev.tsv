0	5	0	0	0	their prices may be higher than some asian cleaners but their quality of service is excellent. it really shows they take care of their customers clothing. i have never had my shirts packed so nicely when i pick them up at other cleaners. and looking over their work i found no flaws. ...  ... you get what you pay for here. and i will continue to be their customer :)
0	1	0	0	0	I had a very bad experience with the store.  Very rude seamstress. She cost the company she works for money because my husband and I will never go there again.  If you are looking for a friendly family business, do not go to Boston cleaners on West Charleston they are expensive, rude and unfriendly.
0	5	0	0	0	I was on vacation and found this cleaners in the area. They were super friendly and the place is clean. The prices are a bit higher then other places, but they found some casino chips in my pants pocket and returned them to me when I picked up my clothes! VERY IMPRESSED!
2	4	0	0	1	Burgers, Fries and a milkshake. Life doesn't get any better. The burgers are really good and so are the fries. But what really sticks out are the milkshakes. The Oreo milkshake is my favorite and I cannot get enough. This is the place to go to satisfy that burger, fries and a milkshake craving after a hot summer day of chilling by the pool.
2	5	0	1	1	Everyone in my family was sad to see this place close down several years ago but we were all excited to see it open again on a recent trip.  Great fries, great garden burgers (most of us are vegetarian) and great milkshakes.  A recent trip to Chandler Mall included lunch at Ruby's followed by a trip later in the shopping spree to consume some milkshakes.  Not a bad way to spend the day (and 5,000 calories!).
2	4	1	2	1	I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it.  4 stars for the diner category.  Our first visit here was for brunch.  I tried out the Carnitas Skillet.  It was good, but I discovered carnitas is not great in a scramble.  The potatoes were great.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros and was gracious enough to share with me...good stuff. ...  ... The kids had a burger & mac' n cheese.  Both were good.  The staff here was very friendly and helpful and every request for this or that was met with a "sure!". ...  ... Our waitress was very good and had this almost Amy Winehouse look going on.  I thought she was hitting on my wife as she kept referring to her as "sweetie" or "honey" or "babe" or...but by midway through the meal this had transferred to all of us.
3	3	0	0	0	3 1/2 STARS ...  ... This is Marriott's TIME-SHARE complex across from their luxury hotel. We traded a time-share for a week here in May. I must say, the place was packed - it appeared to be fully occupied. ...  ... Our room was small but just fine for us. The employees were all friendly and the grounds were kept in good shape. ...  ... We found this to be a good place to use as a base for a week's holiday while taking day-trips to the Grand Canyon, Sedona, Prescott, Scottsdale, the Phoenix Botanical Garden, and so on...
3	4	1	3	0	My friend got the time-share suite (2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and 2 balaconys).  SWEET!  We had a wonderful time enoying complex.  The grounds were well kept.   ...  ... The pool area was walking distance.  2 large pools (1 pool had a waterfall, volleyball, and basketball), 2 hot tub areas, 1 kiddie pool.   ...  ... Stayaction for the weekend!
3	5	0	3	0	I traded my lockout unit (Extra bedroom) from Desert Springs Marriott Villas in Palm Desert for a one bedroom, living room and dinning area and kitchen. The unit was on the third floor end unit which had a terrific view of the Wildfire Faldo golf course.  ...  ... Marriott Vacation Club is awesome. I've owned the two bedroom unit in Palm Desert location for 16 years and also a two bedroom week in Newport Beach Coast for eleven years. The program is nice BC it allows me to occupy, trade, rent, deposit outside of Marriott or trade my weeks for reward points or vacation points.  ...  ... Canyon Villas is located at the JW Marriott which is great due to you'll have all the amenities of the hotel pool, spa, hotel restaurants, and two 18 hole golf courses within minutes of your villa. If you choose to use the villa amenities  there are several pools, a fitness center, beach volleyball, and daily activities.  ...  ... I highly recommend ownership in Marriott vacation club, the program has enabled me to travel to Phuket & Bangkok Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, Xian, & Beijing China, Bali & Singapore Indonesia, Ho Chi Men Vietnam, several islands in Hawaii, Paris France, Cancun, Puerta Vallarta Mexico, Boston, several cities in Florida, West Virgina, Manhattan, New Orleans, Hilton Head and Savannah. I know i'm missing some places but you get the drift.  ...  ... I've never been let down with Marriott Vacation Club locations that's why I try to stay within the Marriott family - with other timeshares you don't know what your getting. Another pointer is never buy outside the U.S. International Timeshares go under and your screwed. I had a co worker that had that happen in a resort in Mexico.
3	5	0	3	0	This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been on. It was spacious and their bathroom alone was ginormous!!! I would definitely keep going back whenever I'm in town.
3	4	0	1	2	My roomie's father has this timeshare thingy and selected this place and invited us to fly out here. ...  ... Wow!  The Marriott Canyon Villas is one of the nicest places that I've stayed at.  We basically stayed at a huge suite with an adjoining room.  Big kitchen.  Large living room.  Furnished balconies.  Big bathroom.  Washer and dryer included.  You're bound to have a grand time here. ...  ... Except...the beds.  I found the bed to be a little too soft for my comfort.  After my second night there, I spent the rest of the week tossing and turning.  My roomie found better comfort on the couch.  I should have just slept on the floor. ...  ... Everything else was great!  The hot spa was heavenly.  The sauna was relaxing.  The gym is open 24 hours.  There were adequate games available to keep people, especially kids, busy.  There is a mini-convenience store where you can also rent DVDs.   ...  ... Canyon Villas couldn't have picked a better location than at Desert Ridge.  If you go out for a walk or a run, you can't miss this huge beautiful golf course.  In addition, you're bound to see wild quails running around.  Don't be surprised if you spot a jackrabbit here and there.  Plenty of nature sceneries here. ...  ... Friendly staff here.  Awesome place that just need to improve their beds.
3	2	2	4	1	Looking at the schedule of the resort activities upon arrival, we learned that Wednesday was a cowboy sing-along. No, I'm not shitting you. I love my family and we had a great time being with each other, but that really epitomized our opinion of this hokey old-person resort.  ...  ... If you have a timeshare somewhere like Vegas or the Poconos, this place might be worth your while to swap. For us (a family that owns our timeshare in Maui), it was quite a downward step.  ...  ... The room was smaller than our unit in Hawaii, which made little sense; it wasn't dirty, but also didn't feel as clean as other properties we've been to; a light was burned out in our room and the maintenance people neglected to fix it; and the workout room smelled like formaldehyde.  ...  ... The Marriott hotel across the way, however, is ridiculously luxurious. So if you're not bound to renting through the timeshare, you should stay over there instead. If you are bound to the timeshare, you can still use their pools, which is well worth it.
3	4	0	0	0	friendly staff, looks clean, great room amenities. their gym is right in front of the lobby with windows for all to see you sweat. no cardio machines. small snack shop w/ decent prices. bring your own spices for their kitchen.  look for luggage cart to move your things to and from car. free parking and wifi is a plus!
3	4	0	1	0	everything your family needs is on this property. space, cleanliness, modern kitchen, 2 pools, 1 kiddie pool, golf, fitness room, satellite TV, free parking, free wifi, grills on property to BBQ and rabbits for your kids to chase.  ...  ... there is a strip mall not too far from property which will cater to all you needs. its about 35min drive from phoenix airport.  nothing real scenic to go to in scottsdale so enjoy the property as much as you can. ...  ... prices are up there for rental and if you purchase things at their thrift store, expect it to be pricey too. employees and customer service was good! ...  ... we had a great time and cant wait to go back next year!
3	5	0	0	0	You will love Canyon Villas.  Address on Yelp is wrong, & I submitted a correction today.  7/9/2011.  We just returned from our 3rd stay at Canyon Villas, which are located at 5220 Marriott Drive, Phoenix,AZ. There are several buildings with studios, 1, & 2 bedroom/2 bath Villas (like condos).  They are sold as timeshare but can also be rented by anyone & traded into by other owners.  Numerous pools, spas, recreation & the nearby Desert Ridge Shopping Center offer much to do.  The villas & resort landscaping are really beautiful.  2 bedrooms sleep up to 8 people.  1 bedroom 4, & studio 4, but studios are better for 2 people max.  Villas have a full kitchen/dining room with dishwasher, washer/dryer, & all have patio or balcony with tables/chairs.  Resort has gas BBQ's scattered around that you can use.  Most of the time you can use pools at JW also, & Marriott has a free shuttle bus that takes you over there & back & also goes to Desert Ridge shopping center which has an Albertson's Market for your food supplies.  IF YOU PLAY GOLF, THERE ARE 2 SEPARATE COURSES NEXT TO THE RESORT, WILDFIRE IS ONE & I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE OTHER.  Take the Marriott timeshare tour, they are not high pressure & you can get $100.00 in Marriott dining dollars, or Marriott Rewards points.  Most people buy with Marriott as they are the premier timeshare company & owners love the resorts.  They now sell MVC points & you have no home resort, instead of timeshare weeks. It gives you freedom of reserving your time at any of the resorts.   Lots of wildlife live in the resort, owls, quail, rabbits and more.  You will love it!   Go to www.Marriott.com for more information.  No, I don't work for Marriott, but we are loyal and love the Marriott level of service and quality.
3	5	0	2	0	First off, ignore the review from Jen S. 1/19/2011, as it doesn't fall in with other reviewers & we have stayed here 3 summers for the week each time. Canyon Villas is beautiful inside & out & very clean.  If you ever have a problem call to report it & they will fix it quickly.  Hispanic maids at hotels never seem to report stuff like clogged drains or leaky faucets, etc.(in my experience).  Marriott service is amazing. Yes, they do have a cowboy singer who is at the firepit for about an hour so, who plays a guitar, but you don't have to sign along, & it is not a detriment.  This resort is not for old people, or hokey in the least.  It is beautiful with multiple pools on site (as well as those you can use at the adjacent Marriott JW Hotel).  The rooms at the hotel are smaller & no kitchen/washer dryer, etc.  If you like to cook your own meals, like having a balcony with table/chairs, dishwasher, & all amenities, incl. granite counters throughout, then the Villas are for you.  They can be rented by the night using Marriott reservations number or www.marriott.com.  Select Marriott Vacation Club for the search by hotel type & enter Phoenix.  There are now DVD players in every room, the "studio" (lockoff unit), the 1 bedroom master & the living room.  These 3 components equal a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit.  You can rent 2 bedroom as stated, or just the studio with mini kitchen (small fridge, microwave), living room, sleeper sofa & king bed, full bathroom.  The 1 bedroom is the master unit with separate bedroom, bathroom with large shower, sink & toilet, plus a large soaking tub & 2nd sink.  Living room also has a dining table that sits 6 people with included chairs.  Marriott is upgrading sleeper sofas in all units when they come up for renovations to a new type that was tested at Marriott Villas Mountainside Park City Utah.  They are made by American Leather & are memory foam mattresses that fold out & are much, much better than the existing standard metal frame & lumpy old mattresses.   No telling when all locations will have them.   There is a special kids pool area at the north end of the Villas resort.  It has sprayers in the concrete, etc.  There is also a separate playground area between some of the buildings at the north end.  Each building is 3 stories high & each building has an elevator.  Generally these units are pretty quiet in my experience.  I have found the Canyon Villas to have a very good maid staff & they are very clean.  We usually trade our week for a week each year at Canyon Villas because we love it.  I love the desert & the landscaping & wildlife at Canyon Villas is just beautiful.  There is a free shuttle to the JW each hour & they go to Desert Ridge Shopping Center every 2 hours on the even hour.  Desert Ridge has BJ's Brewpub, Barnes & Noble, Dave & Busters entertainment,a large movie theatre, Kohls, & numerous other large restaurants & shopping.  You also get your groceries to stock the villa there at Albertsons (a great market).    We always can't wait to go back every year.   There is lots to do if you want to venture out, like the Phoenix Art Museum, Bot. Gardens, Zoo, Arizona Rock & Mineral Museum, visit the State Capital building, etc.  There is Wildfire Golf Course on one side of the property & another amazing Golf course on the other side.   Oh, the beds are the same as in the JW, firm, but have a pillow topper on them.  Super comfortable always!  Also, as the units are updated, they are going to have all stainless steel appliances.   If you do the highly recommended Marriott tour, you will see the updated unit they use for showing.  Marriott is a great company & timeshare tours are not high pressure.  It is a great product & well worth buying into.  They no longer sell weeks, just points & you no longer are tied to a home resort.  You can use your points annually for where ever you want to stay.  You buy a point value & still pay maint. fees based on the point value you buy.
3	5	0	1	0	We just got back from a weekend at the Villas and everything was fantastic. Great service, beautiful rooms (we had two two-bedroom condos), beautiful grounds. The beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked for cooking.  We also used the gas grills to BBQ.   ...  ... We were really impressed with the staff both at the Villas and at the main resort (Marriott Desert Ridge) across the street. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, even in the 105 summer temperatures. For pool time we preferred the Marriott/hotel side of the resort (the Villas office will provide you with a wristband to get pool access there).   The main hotel has two pools and a lazy river.   There are two pools at the Villas but the area is smaller and it feels more crowded.  The hotel also has a few restaurants, including a Roy's with patio seating and happy hour from 4 to 6pm.  Although we spent a lot of time on the hotel side of this resort, I always prefer the condos for kicking back, relaxing and for eating in when we want to.  ...  ... We'll definitely go back.
3	5	0	1	0	Back after one year but instead I traded my efficiency unit for a two bedroom - scored! ... The staff filled my request and gave me a high floor and golf course view. ...  ... The two bedroom was spacious and I really enjoyed the extra bedroom and bathroom. HD Direct TV was included and wireless internet is also complimentary. Staying here also gave access to the JW Marriott fitness center and pool and I utilized the Revive Spa with a Swedish massage. The Canyon villas offers shuttle service to the JW Marriott every half hour or you can take a 10 minute walk over which you can dine at 4 different restaurants and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. ...  ... For those of you who don't know me I enjoy golfing and the Phoenix area has 119 public golf courses. I can visit the area and play different courses at various price ranges. The Marriott resort has two 18 hole golf courses one designed by Arnold Palmer and the other by Nick Faldo and both are upscale and in great condition. ...  ... So if your into spa, golf, dinning or all of the above check out Marriott Canyon Villas.
3	4	0	0	0	After spending endless time looking at condos on VRBO and other properties, we settled on the Canyon Villas, and were really, really happy with the decision.  ... In looking at traveling with kids, and with family in the area that we wanted to spend time with, we thought it was critical to have a full kitchen and ample space for us to spread out.  The Canyon Villas have all of this, and at a very high level.  ... We chose a ground floor 1-bedroom unit that backed onto the courtyard, which includes 2 shuffleboard courts, numerous gas fire pits, and three spotless grills.  It was ideal for family, and we used the grills nightly, which ended up being a great place to meet the other owners/renters. ...   ... The staff was superb, and the property was spotless.  ...  ... You do have access to the JW Marriott across the street, either via an on-the-half-hour shuttle or by walking.  In our case, the shuttle driver was under-utilized, and was basically on call, which was spectacular.  The JW is a gorgeous property, and the pool/lazy-river is top notch.  They have super-pricey dining options if you are leaning that way.   ...  ... Not having to eat out for every meal made fora very relaxing time, and not having to really venture off of the property for entertainment was even better.  The pools at the villas themselves are more than adequate for just about everybody - they just lack the lazy river - but have food & drink service, fountains, air hockey, etc. ...  ... It isn't cheap, but they have military and AAA discounts (we used AAA and saved a few bucks).  It really balances out if you do your cooking in the unit or on the grills - there is a very complete Albertsons less than 5 minutes away, along with a massive strip mall with any number of awful chain restaurants that you might want to utilize.   ...  ... For golfers - $199 seems absurd for a resort course, so I didn't play Wildfire.  Shop golfnow.com - there are deals everywhere in Phoenix on good courses - I found Legend Trail (~15 minutes North) for half that amount.   ...  ... Highly recommended.
3	4	0	1	0	This is a great family resort if you need a villa with a kitchen, washer/dryer and space. We have stayed at Marriott Vacation Clubs all over the U.S. and we really love it here. It's not too big but is in a perfect location for us. You can use the pool at the JW Marriott across the way, but my kids loved the pool here and it's easier to use. The pool was heated to a perfect temperature!  Across the way is the Desert Ridge Marketplace with an Albertson's, 24 hour CVS, Einstein bagels, many other fun restaurants, AMC movies, big box shopping like Marshall's, Ross, etc. It's very convenient for shopping and dining as well as getting to the 101 highway for all of the fun places to go nearby.  ...  ... I also found a great nail place across from Desert Ridge called "All About Nails". Very nice and very clean - plus reasonably priced. ...  ... We will return when we need a Scottsdale base for vacation. Our only complaint was check in was 2.5 hours late (6:30 PM instead of 4:00 PM), and the lack of pool towels on 2 days. Otherwise a well-run vacation club.
3	5	1	1	1	This place is awesome.  The place is beautiful and immaculate.  The golf course in front is stunning and I hope to play here in April.  There is a huge shopping mall with a supermarket, movie place and shopping so we made dinner in our condo tonight.  There is a lighted lounge area outside my room with BBQ grilles and shuffleboard courts.  The bathtub is huge and my wife loved taking a long bubble bath.
3	5	0	0	0	Great views, great customer service.
3	3	0	0	0	The rooms are absolutely first class, but I would not consider staying here again.  A few hours across the street at the JW Marriott proved most relaxing.  Unfortunately, it is a bit of a hassle to get over there.  There is nothing really in walking distance, and you need to drive a good distance to find a decent place to eat.
3	4	1	3	2	You can bet it will be a nice resort if it carries the Marriott name.  ...  ... They are consistent, even though some are still nicer than others.  Canyon Villas is located in upper Phoenix where the air is a bit cleaner, the view a bit nicer, open spaces and grand desert views, but still conveniently close to amenities. Accessible to the freeway and lots of shopping, it is living the good life. Well.....maybe not when it is 122 degrees outside, or a torrential monsoonal rain that can float your car away, or even a nasty dust storm.  Yes, it can have it's occasional down sides. ...  ... There are plenty of directions to go to find good food, entertainment, educational attractions, culture. I do lots of Yelp research and Grouponing for about a week or two before I come here, just to catch up on what's to do and see around here.   ...  ... The villas are beautiful and comfortable, good beds too. And then you have gorgeous desert landscaping, beautiful pools, patios, golf courses, a spa, kids' play areas, and fun scheduled activities (how about duct tape wallet making for one) if you would rather not go out in your car. Add to that the neighboring JW Marriott, with all its finery, with shuttle service every half hour to and from the resort. If you stay at this resort, all those things are part of the package. ...  ... And it is a convenient ~5 1/2 hour trip from Los Angeles area. ...  ... Mr. B and I like it here.
3	5	0	0	0	Bought here 8 years ago with absolutely no regrets.  The villas are wonderfully appointed and the atmosphere is great.  The staff goes above and beyond to come up with activities at the Villas.  Access to the main resort makes it equally appealing.  Also a short distance from lots of great dining and shopping.
3	5	0	0	0	I'm an owner and I am critical, but I couldn't be more impressed with the Canyon Villas.  The Staff - remembered my name and building.   ... The shuttle driver - remember my building and information ... The JW Marriott - was available ever 30 minutes via shuttle ... The Pool staff at JW Marriott - was friendly and explained what/how to enjoy the facilities ... The Marketing Staff - was not pushy and made me want to come back.  ... The tour guides - informative and fun ... The Cowboy Singer - had a great voice and did a wonderful Rawhide set ... The only thing I would suggest is that on Monday morning, get mics for the presenters or tell the grounds keepers to lay off the blowers and keep quiet for the one hour so we can hear what is available during the week.   ... I can't wait to come back.  I stayed in a lock off (no kitchen) but bbq'd every night.  Staff brought me a blender (not normally in the lock off) and made my stay wonderful.
3	5	0	0	0	Omg Tyson was the most helpful person I've ever met in the whole world. He made my whole expirence amazing! His awesome attitude was just a step above and beyond the call of duty. He should be the CEO of this place. Or at least a $2.83 raise!!!! Worth every penny of my time and money!!!!!!!!! ...  ...  ... Heart ya Ty!!!!!
4	4	0	0	0	Always packed which is a good sign! Very good food
4	3	3	2	2	Another strip mall joint, this place has pretty good pizza, but their entree items are better. Have had some good lasagna there, and eggplant Parmesan. I just don't like the atmosphere... I feel like I'm dining in a storefront ... Oops, I am!
4	4	1	1	1	I love Nicks!  Casual, consistent, well priced.  Great Osso Bucco, homemade pastas, love the seafood ravioli.  Several locations in the valley but we like the Frank Lloyd Wright one.  Sometimes the service is just ok but lately, seems to have improved.   ... Nothing fancy, just good food at a reasonable price.
4	5	0	0	0	I love this place!they have amazing chicken parm and I love the bread they served with olive oil and vinegar. Not to pricey but a good restaurant. I come here often with my family. Love the small family restaurant. You have to try this place!
4	5	0	0	0	Consistently good Italian food. Reasonably priced wine.  Love the antipasto misto.
4	5	0	0	0	Nick's is the mom and pop of AZ Italian restraunt must! The food is always consitently great! I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata. :) It is a very casual place as far as decore but the food is what does it for me.  I would have to agree with Ronald's review below. (The two chair in the middle... worth waiting for a better table)
4	3	4	5	3	I've been to Nick's a couple of times. The place is always mobbed by couples, groups and families. I don't get it, but I guess I'm in the minority on this one. ...  ... The bread is outstanding, the service is ok, but nothing to write home about. The Chicken Parmasean is so so. I only finished one of the two pieces of chicken because it was so meh. And the Linguini with Clams was unspectacular as well.
4	2	1	2	1	The prices are about 2 bucks more than their website.  Their sauce had a lot of sugar, not unlike ChefBoyArDee. The bread seemed like it included cornmeal, not tasty.  The service was just okay.
4	3	0	2	0	A favorite of my wife's. It is not a bad place but nothing exciting it is ok. So when my wife wants to go I usually take her. You know a happy wife makes for a happy me
4	4	0	0	0	Nice local Italian spot. Nice daily specials. Everything is fresh and very tasty with a nice presentation. I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. The one area they need help is with their bread.
4	1	6	7	2	How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between "parmesan" and "parmagiana," so they just combine them into a made up word. (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA?) ...  ... "Parmagiana" is a style of cooking. "Parmesan" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti. ...  ... God! People can be so stupid.
4	5	0	0	0	LOVE! I love this place the greek salad is so addicting I could eat it everyday.  I always get the spaghetti with tomato sauce its pretty basic but the sauce it very sweet and delish!  It is a neighborhood place where you go in and you will know someone! Overall Excellent!
4	3	3	3	0	For an appropriate metaphor to Nick's restaurant, one need only look to the chicken section of their menu. ...  ... Piccata? Yes, quite. ...  ... Marsala? Ahh, of course, a staple. ...  ... Parmesana? Why certai-- wait. What? What the fuck is Parmesana? I get what Parmesan (Parmigiano) is: it's a dry, hard granular cheese. I'm also familiar with Parmigiana (which means "from Parma," Northern Italy): it's usually used to denote a particular breaded meat/eggplant dish that is bathed in sauce and cheese. Parmesana, on the other hand, isn't a word. One could write it off as a simple spelling error, but they repeat that exact mode in the following veal section. ...  ... So, there it is. Nick's is essentially a generic place that doesn't quite know its identity, and it does it extremely well without anyone ever noticing. ...  ... Nick's is a restaurant for people that are afraid of change; afraid of diversity; afraid of trying something new. While I can't say there's anything wrong with ordering Chicken Parmesan or Spaghetti and Meatballs every time you go out to dinner, it's not for me. After all, Nick's would be ridiculed amongst the pretentious diners of NYC, and I feel similarly. Every time my parents take me there (it is my father's favorite restaurant, which is very telling of his tastes in food) I can't find anything on the menu that sounds interesting enough to pop off the page. When I eat the food, I can't find anything about it that is exceptional enough to remain in my memory. ...  ... But, it is perfectly palatable, freakishly fresh food. I can't help but play devil's advocate and offer the argument that this is a great restaurant for people who like generic American-Italian food and are tired of (or too good for) Olive Garden. You know who you are. Just don't expect any breadsticks at Nick's.
4	5	0	0	0	Best Italian food in north Scottsdale for the money.  If you know of another one, let me know.  Their antipasto misto is the best I've had in AZ. Linguini with clams is to die for :) Very friendly service.  I'll never go back to Macaroni Grill!

4	4	0	1	0	Nick's Italian Restaurant (13910 N. Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ) aims to please with a menu diverse in selection. Tinted windows, location inside a small strip mall on N. Frank Lloyd Wright makes for an unassuming establishment.  Upon entering, you are welcomed into a simple environment with a menu where one can find everything from traditional Italian pasta dishes to dishes with veal or seafood.  ...  ... Their traditional garden salad is a generous portion of lettuce, a sprinkle of tomato, and cucumbers served with your choice of ranch, blue cheese or house vinaigrette dressing ($3.95).   You receive a large portion of salad for this unbeatable price.  The house vinaigrette in particular, is light and coats every inch of the salad with taste. ...  ... For the main course, the "chicken parmesana" ($14.95) as spelled on their menu, takes a different twist.  Instead of a coated breaded chicken breast, theirs is simply a grilled chicken breast covered with a thick covering of mozzarella and mild marinara sauce.  Along with this dish, a serving of spaghetti with marinara sauce give the pasta compliment to this dish.  There is no lack of mozzarella cheese on this dish; every bite brings a delicious taste to any cheese lover.  ...  ... For dessert, their homemade chocolate chip cannoli ($5.95) is not to be missed.  A savory pastry shell is filled with traditional cannoli style cream, topped with many chocolate chips.  It is a most filling dessert; their cannoli can easily be split between two individuals. ...  ... With a simple atmosphere, Nick's simply focuses on what is most important - the food.  With a menu with many selections to choose from and delectable dishes, you can find a hearty Italian specialty easily at Nick's Italian Restaurant.
4	4	0	0	0	Yes, I am a fan of Nick's Italian Resto on FLW in North Scottsdale.  They have a great selection of salads here, works well if you are on a low carb or non processed food diet.  My favorite is the Di Mare salad which I modify to my liking, no shrimp and choice of oil and vinegar dressing.  Vegetarian?  They have caprese salad and pasta choices.  Lunch specials are available too for under $10.00.  The food here is tasty and delicious.  The only drawback to this place is the ambiance and the service.  They have black checked tablecloths, some Italian food decor, looks ordinary.  The service is hit and miss.  Take out is always a good choice.

I typically get penne with red sauce and sausage. This was the first time I ran out of pasta prior to running out of sausage! That's what I call loading it up with the good stuff! Also had a house salad which was an extra $4 or so (bummer that not included). A variety of different breads to warm you up. Save room for the tiramisu! Even if no room left, make some. Made fresh in house daily and probably some of the best ever.  ...  ... I'm a value guy. If soup or salad was included with the dinner, would have received 5 stars. Not knocking it in any way because it didn't. I'll be going back and see myself becoming a regular.  It was obvious that everyone there was a local!

We each added on a side salad - it  was a typical salad for a restaurant, mixed greens with one slice of tomato; per usual, disappointing. However, I got the greek dressing and really liked it.  ... I felt the price was reasonable, but enjoyed it more with the groupon offer. They had a long list of specials that looked good and there were several menu items I would like try. I will check them out again sometime.

We were told 10 minutes wait.  20 minutes later we were still standing (no available chairs to wait in) against the wall.  (If the Groupon wasn't expiring, we would have left.)  Servers were desparately trying to navigate the tables and the crowded entrance to serve the patio area.  I admired the fact that most still continued to smile in the face of such a crowd.  Finally we were seated in a high traffic area, our chairs were continually bumped with each passing waiter or guest.  This was not fun or relaxing. ...  ... About the food.  Definitely not worth the wait.  We both had salads (because the pasta dishes do not come with any sides).  The wedge salad was covered with bleu cheese dressing, w/ sliced tomatoes and onions on the side.  House salad had a very nice balsamic dressing but the salad was 1 kind of lettuce & a couple cuke & tomato slices - we were not impressed, esp. for the price.  Penne Alla Campagna sounded good w/ spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms & chicken - but it was somewhat bland, chicken was tough.  Lasagna didn't fare much better on our table.   ...  ... I wonder if the experience might have been different on a less busy night.  If they are always this busy, then I guess they won't miss our business.  With all the many choices in Italian, we won't be returning to Nick's.
4	5	2	3	1	LOVE NICKS! I have been coming here for many years... and the food has always been really good... at really reasonable prices. ...  ... I tend to stick with the pasta dishes... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade. My favorite dish on the menu it the fresh pasta, homemade sausage, peppers and onions, in a marinara sauce... amazing! I have also had the chicken marsala... also very good.  ...  ... The tiramisu dessert is amazing... make sure you save room. Also they sever Illy coffee which is wonderful. Great way to cap of the meal.  ...  ... My one word of warning is: Do Not overdo it on the bread before your meals arrives on the table!  ...  ... A true testament to this place is that everytime I come in it is always BUSY! This is true on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday.
